## This file intentionally left blank.
## The default system is always set to display the global header and profile sections of the UI
## This setting is made in the initialise.inc script

## This file can be overridden where appropriate - e.g. embedded themed systems such as the nrmmtheme-nlyte
## to provide logic in the overlay to switch off the global header and profile if appropriate
